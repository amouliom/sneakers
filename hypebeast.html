      <p>Hypebeast are what make the sneaker game so boring. Hypebeast are people who only hype up sneakers that are just popular. Also they have no knowledge of any kind of sneaker they wear. For example,
        if you ask a hypebeast if Michael Jordan played in his Air Jordan 9s they would say yes because he retired when he wore his 14s, AKA the "Last Shots". If they were a real "sneakerhead" they would know that Michael retired from basketball to play baseball.

          <p>Hypebeast have been around since the early 2000s. Over the years it has been evolved to many different kinds of hypebeast since then. An example would be someone from 2012. The name for this type of hypebeast is the "Designer dripped" outfit. The Outfit would consist of Givenchy, En Noir, SSUR, Black Scale, 3.1 Phillip Lim, Balmain, and Comme des Garcons. On the left is what the outfit would look like.
