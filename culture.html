            <p>It seems a long way from a training shoe created in 1917 to the gaudy and much-coveted street-wear of today, but a new book demonstrates the long and lucrative history of the sneaker--and the sportsmen who became the brands' ambassadors.</p>

          <h1>Sneaker Impact</h1>
            <p>Today, sneakers are a hugely lucrative juggernaut. In 2012, for instance, Nike’s line of LeBron James sneakers generated $300 million—in the U.S alone. Apparently everybody still wants to be like Mike—so much so that kids get shot over pairs of his namesake sneakers. And the footwear’s infiltration of the fashion world is pretty much complete.</p>

           <p>The generations that raised us had a dress shoe, a work shoe, and a sneaker for yard work. A decade ago, the scene was what it was: Emerging. You were doing something first and there was no precedent set before you. Today, there’s a generation of heads who have seen their older brothers, sisters, cousins, and parents turn to collecting. It's hit the mainstream. Everyone is in on it—and what a time it is.

          <p>Research shows that the secondary market is upwards of $1 billion. There were small-time resellers in the mid-00s, but the lengths that consumers go to purchase their kicks has changed dramatically. Relationships with store employees and managers used to be key. The interpersonal hookup was cherished as you were literally doing backdoor deals to cop multiples.</p>
          <p>In 2016, bots buying out stock and secret links to kicks all mean that it’s grown increasingly difficult to obtain the sneaker you want, because they’re sold out online before you’ve even had a chance. The money changed everything—and now everyone wants a piece of the pie. We've seen something that we love change before our eyes.
